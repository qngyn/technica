                        <p>In 1995, 81% of adolescent males and 87% of adolescent females reported having received instruction on birth control methods. However, in 2015-19, the percentage dropped to 63% and 64% respectively.</p>
                        <p>In 2015-19:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adolescent females were more likely than males to report being instructed to wait until marriage to have sex (67% vs 58%).</li>
                            <li>Males were more likely to report being instructed about condoms (60% vs 55%).</li>
                            <li>Adolescents attending religious services at least once a week were more likely than other peers to report having received instruction to delay having sex until marriage and less likely to report having received instruction about birth control methods.</li>

                        <p>121 million, or almost half of all pregnancies, each year are unintentional worldwide. For the females affected, reproduction is no longer a choice, as explained by the State of World Population 2022 report.</p>
                        <h2>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</h2>
                        <p>“More than 1 million STIs are acquired every day. In 2020, WHO estimated 374 million new infections with 1 of 4 STIs: chlamydia (129 million), gonorrhoea (82 million), syphilis (7.1 million), and trichomoniasis (156 million).”</p>
                        <h2>Impact of Internet Pornography</h2>
                        <p>Dena Abbott, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a licensed psychologist, said another problem with the early consumption of free unethical internet porn can be that it gives unrealistic expectations of what sex is.</p>
                        <p>“In that type of pornography, we often don't see the process of communication about sex, of consent, negotiating what feels pleasurable and what people are open to and what they're not,” Abbott said. “That component of sex is typically missing; it just doesn't teach you to have sex well.”</p>
