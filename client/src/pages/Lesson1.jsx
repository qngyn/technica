                                Ejaculatory fluid consists of sprem, semen, and fluid from the prostate. When a person ejaculates, it comes out of the penis. Parts of the reproductive tract produce, carry, and release ejaculatory fluid. Ejaculatory fluid can cause a pregrnancy when the sperm meets and fertilizes an egg.

                            Some poeple have different opinions about what qualifies as sex. It's critical that when we talk about people having or not having sex, students know what wwe mean. This is important becuase of what it means for pregnancy an infection. 
                            For example, people have different thoughts about anal sex. Even though it doesn't cause pregnancy, it can be a way to spread STIs and HIV.
